Title: The Realm of Echoes
By: Allen Rehkemper & AI

Elias was thirteen the night the world stopped making sense. He had returned from school to find the house hollow. No note. No explanation. Just silence, louder than anything he'd ever heard. His parents were gone.

He waited. Days turned to weeks. Teachers stopped calling. Neighbors stopped asking. He scavenged what food he could, wore the same clothes for days, and kept a candle lit by the window every night. Just in case.

Then came the flickers.

At first, shadows that danced just outside his vision. Then whispers-words that didn't belong in this world. A glimmering figure appeared behind the condensation on the bathroom mirror, calling his name in a voice like wind chimes. "Elias..."

He thought he was losing his mind. But the more he saw them, the more they became real. One evening, as he wandered through the woods behind his neighborhood, the air shimmered like heat off asphalt, and a creature stepped through.

It looked like a fusion of owl and cat-wise, regal, absurd.

"I am Corwin," it said, blinking mismatched eyes. "You are needed."

"I think you're in the wrong universe," Elias said, stepping back.

"You've been seen, child. You're the Warden of Realms."

He laughed. "I'm just a kid whose parents left him."

But that night, in dreams or waking (he wasn't sure), the world split. A rift tore the sky open, and Elias stepped through into a land where the grass whispered secrets and the stars moved like fireflies.

The Realm of Echoes.

It was beautiful-unreal in every way. Trees that breathed. Rivers that sang. Creatures that bowed when Elias passed. They called him "High One," and when he asked why, they told him of a prophecy: A boy with sorrow in his bones would heal the realm from the Dark Mist.

Corwin guided him. He met allies-a girl with hair like fire who could summon storms, a talking stone that rolled beside him cracking riddles, and a phoenix that refused to burn.

He faced trials. Solved puzzles that tested his heart, not just his mind. Faced creatures corrupted by the Mist-twisted versions of joy, hollow-eyed and desperate.

Then came the cave.

The mirrors.

Each one showed a version of Elias: happy, angry, broken, cruel. And behind one-his parents. Smiling. Reaching.

"Are you real?" he whispered.

They didn't answer.

At the cave's end stood the Echo King. Tall. Familiar.

It was Elias.

But older, crueler. A version of him that had given up.

"You created me," the Echo King said. "You needed me."

"No," Elias said. "I needed truth."

They fought-not with fists, but with memories. Laughter. Tears. Screams into empty houses.

Elias won.

The realm crowned him. The sky lit with auroras. Creatures danced.

He was home.

But the realm began to fade. Corwin wept. "This place... it was never meant to stay. You built it to survive."

Elias clutched the crown. "Then let it go."

He woke in a hospital bed.

White walls. Fluorescent lights.

The social worker beside him looked exhausted. "You're back," she whispered.

No parents.

No magic.

But someone had stayed.

Elias cried-and this time, it wasn't to escape.

It was to begin.

Sometimes, the worlds we create are the bridges back to ourselves.
