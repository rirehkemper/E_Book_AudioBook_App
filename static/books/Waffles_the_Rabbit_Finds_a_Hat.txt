Title: Waffles the Rabbit Finds a Hat
By: Allen Rehkemper & AI

Waffles was not your ordinary Rabbit.

He didn't care for naps or digging up Carrots. No, Waffles loved one thing more than anything else in the whole wide world... **hats**.

Big hats, tiny hats, shiny hats, and hats shaped like bananas-Waffles loved them all.

He lived with Grandma Nelly in a cozy blue house with a red door and a garden that smelled like jellybeans. Every morning, Grandma Nelly would say, "No more hats, Waffles. You have seventy-two already!"

But Waffles would smile (as only a rabbit can) and sneak out on a new hat-finding adventure.

One sunny Tuesday, Waffles put on his polka-dot detective cap and declared, "Today, I will find the most *wonderful* hat in the world!"

He trotted down Jellybean Lane, past the giggling tulips and the mailbox that liked to hum.

First stop: Mr. Toadsworth's Bakery.

"Any new hats?" Waffles asked, sniffing the air.

"Only bread," said Mr. Toadsworth. "But you're welcome to this baguette shaped like a helmet."

Waffles balanced the baguette on his head. "Too crusty," he said, and wobbled on.

Next stop: The library, where Mrs. Snuggleboots the Owl wore glasses and knew everything.

"I need a hat that makes people giggle and say 'Wow!'" Waffles told her.

Mrs. Snuggleboots blinked. "Try the old oak tree. Strange things grow there."

So Waffles did.

At the old oak tree, he found it: a hat made of rainbow feathers, glittering buttons, a spinning top, and a small music box that played circus tunes.

It was perfect.

He ran all the way home.

Grandma Nelly gasped. "Waffles! That's the silliest, happiest hat I've ever seen!"

And Waffles said proudly. "Hat number seventy-three."

From that day on, Waffles became *The Rabbit With the Hat That Made People Laugh*.

He didn't need riches or fish or fame.

Just a really good hat.

Sometimes, a great hat is all it takes to make the world a little brighter.
